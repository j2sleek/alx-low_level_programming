# INTRODUCTION
Nested loops, functions, prototype and scope of variables

### 0. putchar
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line. [0-putchar](./0-putchar.c)
- The program should return 0

### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. [1-alphabet](./1-alphabet.c)
- Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code

### 2. 10 x alphabet
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. [2-print_alphabet_x10](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c)
- Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
- You can only use _putchar twice in your code

### 3. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character. [3-islower](./3-islower.c)
- Prototype: int _islower(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is lowercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

### 4. isalpha
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character. [4-isalpha](./4-isalpha.c)
- Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
- Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise

### 5. Sign
Write a function that prints the sign of a number. [5-sign.c](./5-sign.c)
- Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

### 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer. [6-abs](./6-abs.c)
- Prototype: int _abs(int);

### 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number. [7-print_last_digit](./7-print_last_digit.c)
- Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
- Returns the value of the last digit
